# 🖐 Air Drawing App using OpenCV + MediaPipe 🎨

This beginner-friendly project helped me get hands-on experience with real-time video processing, gesture tracking, and interactive UI logic.

I explored the basics of OpenCV and MediaPipe by creating an interactive air drawing application! This simple yet fun project allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, with fingertip movements translated into strokes on a virtual canvas — all in real time!

## ⭐ Features

- ✅ Real-time hand landmark detection  
- ✅ Gesture-controlled drawing using index finger  
- ✅ Color switching with keyboard keys:  
  - `R`: Red  
  - `G`: Green  
  - `B`: Blue  
  - `W`: White  
- ✅ Start/Stop drawing toggle (`S` key)  
- ✅ Clear canvas instantly (`C` key)

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV – for video capture, image processing, and drawing  
- MediaPipe – for hand gesture detection  
- NumPy – for array manipulation
